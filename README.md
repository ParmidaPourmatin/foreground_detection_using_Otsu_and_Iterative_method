# foreground_detection_using_Otsu_and_Iterative_method

This project is about detecting the foreground of an image using Otsu's method and iterative method.

## Otsu's method

Otsu's method is a thresholding method that is used to find the optimal threshold value for an image. It is based on the assumption that the image has two classes of pixels: foreground and background. The method calculates the threshold value that maximizes the between-class variance of the image.

## Iterative method

The iterative method is a thresholding method that is used to find the optimal threshold value for an image. It is based on the assumption that the image has two classes of pixels: foreground and background. The method calculates the threshold value that maximizes the between-class variance of the image.
